* **Latency Analysis:** A small table showing the "End-to-End Latency": Time from *Camera Capture* -> *MQTT* -> *AI Inference* ->  *App Update* . (e.g., "Average Latency: 350ms"). This proves the "Real-time" claim.
* **Stress Test:** Mention how long the device ran without crashing (e.g., "Stable operation for 24+ hours validated memory leak absence").
